## Reference Paper
**Photo-Realistic Monocular Gaze Redirection Using Generative Adversarial Networks** <br />
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12530)]

The original paper implemented the model using TensorFlow 1.7. Since many functions are no longer supported in current versions, I decided to reimplement the gaze redirection model using PyTorch.

## Dependencies

Python == 3.10.15 <br />
torch == 2.5.1 <br />
dlib == 19.24.6 <br />
pillow == 10.4.0

## Methodology

![Method Flowchart](readme_image/gaze_redirection_methodology.jpg)

**Pre-setup and Training Phase**
- Set the **dlib** criteria for determining open and closed eyes
- Use a facial dataset to create eye patches using **dlib** and train the model

**Usage Phase**
- Extract eye patches from individual faces in multiple group photo using dlib and resize them.
- Determine if the eyes are open or closed.
  - If everyone in the photo has their eyes open, perform gaze redirection and copy the image to the usable photo folder.
  - If anyone in the photo has their eyes closed, treat the photo as NG (not good) and move it to a separate folder.
